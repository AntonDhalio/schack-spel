# Good to know about this chess app

This was my first delve into React and JavaScript in any larger capacity.
The basic functions of a chess game are there; you can move the pieces according to their own individual rules but you can't put the opponent in check or checkmate.

You can try it out on through the following link: https://antondhalio.github.io/schack-spel/

## Areas to improve on in the future

There is no checkmate or check implemented in this first version, and the game will not end if a player is in checkmate.

When I started i wasn't very well versed in component based architecture, and as such the code got quite monolithic and not very well structured. I would like to go back and restructure the code so it follows more of a React(-isch) approach and so it gets to be more readable.
